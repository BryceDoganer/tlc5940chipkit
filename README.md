tlc5940chipkit
================================

This is a TLC5940 Library designed for Digilent's ChipKIT board

With the exception of Vcc, the TLC should be wired to the chipkit in the same way that it would be wired to an arduino. Since the chipkit runs at 3.3V instead of 5V, the TLC should be powered using 3.3V instead of 5V. Like the arduino, the LEDs themselves can be powered using any voltage up to 17V. It is recommended that you supply the LEDs with at least 5V.
